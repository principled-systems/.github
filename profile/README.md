The <a href="https://principled.systems">Principled Systems Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)</a> is led by <a href="https://andrea.lattuada.me">Andrea Lattuada</a>.
We design, implement, and verify systems software, construed broadly[^1] and focus on the advancement of verification tooling and methodology for systems verification.

We are interested in <span style="font-weight: bold;">systems software verification</span> as a way to substantially improve their safety and reliability, but to achieve this, the verification effort must be commensurate to the value it provides. We build (verified) systems, and extend the available tooling to find and fix inefficiencies.
